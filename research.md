\## Our Research Focus



The McKinnon Lab is committed to a multi-faceted approach to understanding endometriosis. Our primary research areas include:



\### 1. Endometriosis Pathogenesis and Cellular Models

We investigate the fundamental cellular and molecular pathways that drive endometriosis. Our work utilizes patient-derived cells to develop and characterize advanced \*in vitro\* models, including:

\*   \*\*Stem Cell Organoids:\*\* 3D models of endometrial tissue for studying disease progression and drug responses.

\*   \*\*Endometrial, Endothelial, and Immune Cell Co-cultures:\*\* Reconstructing the complex cellular environment of the endometrium to identify key interactions.



\### 2. Genetic Manipulation via CRISPR-Cas9

We employ CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to precisely manipulate specific genes implicated in endometriosis. This allows us to:

\*   Identify the functional roles of genetic variants in disease development.

\*   Uncover novel therapeutic targets by altering gene expression or function.



\### 3. Multi-Omics Profiling and Spatial Biology

Our lab integrates state-of-the-art omics technologies to generate comprehensive insights into endometriosis at the molecular level:

\*   \*\*Spatial Transcriptomics:\*\* Mapping gene expression profiles directly within tissue sections to understand spatial heterogeneity.

\*   \*\*Proteomics:\*\* Identifying and quantifying proteins to explore signaling pathways and protein-protein interactions.

\*   \*\*Metabolomics:\*\* Analyzing small molecule metabolites to uncover metabolic dysregulation in affected tissues and cells.



By combining these approaches, we aim to build a holistic understanding of endometriosis and pave the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
