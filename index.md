\## Welcome to the McKinnon Lab!



The McKinnon Lab at University of Queensland is at the forefront of endometriosis research. Led by Dr. Brett McKinnon, our team is dedicated to unraveling the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this complex disease.



We leverage cutting-edge techniques, including:

\*   \*\*Advanced Cell Culture Models:\*\* Developing and utilizing stem cell organoids, endometrial, endothelial, and immune cells.

\*   \*\*CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing:\*\* Investigating the functional roles of specific genes in endometriosis pathogenesis.

\*   \*\*Multi-Omics Profiling:\*\* Employing spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to generate comprehensive molecular landscapes.



Our ultimate goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets and contribute to improved diagnostics and treatments for individuals affected by endometriosis.
